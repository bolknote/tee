More than 15 years ago I did quite a lot of assembler programming. Later I lost interest in this language, though. But just recently I was reading one piece of assembler code, and It downed on me that I had never programmed in this language for Linux. Thats why Iâ€™ve decided to try writing a small program in attempt to refresh my skills. 

So, here it is: clone of Linux utility "tee" written in assembler.
