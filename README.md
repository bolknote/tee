More than 15 years ago I programmed a lot in assembler. Later, I lost interest in this language. Recently, reading one code in assembler, I understood that I never programmed in this language for Linux. And I decided to try to write a small program (Linux utility "tee" clone).

My goal is to see how to make syscalls, process command-line options and allocate memory using the assembler.
